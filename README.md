# Rad-report (Radiology Report)

## Project Summary

This is a web application for doctors to use to track patient information.

One of the tools used by doctors to assess the condition of patients with COVID-19 is an X-ray, which creates an image of the patient’s organs and structures within their body. This can help visualize infections such as pneumonia within a patient’s lungs. After performing an x-ray, doctors need a way to record information about what they discovered, so that they can look back at it.

The purpose of this project is to create a web application that allows doctors to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) structured radiology reports as an assessment of X-ray images for exams of patients with COVID-19.
