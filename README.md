# Hack.Diversity Tech Dive Template

## Getting Started

This skeleton contains two different applications -- a front end, or "client," created with "Create React App," and a back end, or "API," created with Express. 

In order to make both of them work together, you'll need to run both, but you can run just one or the other to start. As you begin working on this project, you'll first focus on the client, so you can more or less ignore the API portion of the code for now.

## Client
In order to run the client, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd client/
npm i
npm start
```

You should then be able to visit `localhost:3000` in your browser and see the client running. If you make changes in the `App.js` file, you should see them reflected.

## API
In order to run the server, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd api/
npm i
npm start
```

You should then be able to visit `localhost:9000` in your browser and see the server running.
